# Task 007 - Controls Overlay

## Goal
Add a toggleable edit overlay for the track editor that shows keyboard note inputs.

## Requirements
- Overlay is fixed at the bottom of the window.
- Toggle button is always visible.
- Overlay renders only note keys in a QWERTY-like layout.
- Each key shows the keyboard letter and the note name with octave.
- Note labels update live when shift modifiers change octave.
- Key colors progress through a rainbow from C (yellow) to B (orange).

## Notes
- Keep changes scoped to the editor view.
